Silvercat have decided to open an online bank, Catbank, using our new currency, Silveuros. The new bank will run a promotion giving all new customers 100 free Silveuros when they sign up.

#### Requirements

We would like you to build a prototype web application that allows users to:

- Create an account / log in
- View their current balance and transactions
- Send Silveuros to other users

#### The Solution

- You may use any languages, frameworks or technologies you like
- You should include instructions on how to run/deploy your solution
- Please provide a list of any assumptions you make

#### Expectations

- We don't want you to spend more than a few hours on this test!
- Don't worry if you don't end up with a full working solution

Please provide either an online git repository (e.g. GitHub) or a compressed file containing your solution.

### Approach
